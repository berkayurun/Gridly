#### How to install
Make sure to have Python installed. In addition to that, the following two libraries must be installed:
- Pillow
- requests

While in the root folder, they can be installed using the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

With Python and the requirements installed, you are good to go!

#### How to use
TODO, for now you can run the program with the help flag:

    python main.py -h
